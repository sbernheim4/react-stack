#About

This is a simple MERN stack but without the mongo. I built this both as a way to learn ReactJS, and how to wire it up to compile JSX and serve it effectively. 

#Installation
All you have to do to get started is to clone the project and then from the root folder run `npm install`. Then in one terminal tab `gulp` and in another run `npm start`. Then go to `localhost:1337` in your browser to view the result. 

#Limitations
Right now this app is very simple and has limited capability. Over the coming months I'll build it up to support multiple components, use a UI Router for front end routing and more. 

#Project Structure 
The folder structure is the following:
```
Root
  -app/
  -components/ (JSX files here)
  -public/ (Compiled scss and jsx files and imgs etc )
  -scss/
  -index.html
  -server/
  -gulpfile.js
```
