#About

This is a simple MERN stack but without the mongo. I built this both as a way to learn ReactJS, and how to wire it up to compile JSX and serve it effectively.

##Installation
All you have to do to get started is to clone the project and then from the root folder run `npm install`. Then in one terminal tab run `gulp` and in another run `npm start`. Gulp is used to compile the SCSS while npm start will initiate webpack and start up a local server. Go to `localhost:1337` in your browser to view the result.

##Limitations
Right now this app is very simple and has limited capability. Over the coming months I'll build it up to support multiple components, use a UI Router for front end routing, get livereloading working and more.

##Project Structure
The folder structure is the following:
```
Root
	-src/
		-components/ (all component folders and files here)
			-ComponentOne/
				-ComponentOne.jsx
				-ComponentOne.subcomponent.jsx
			-...
		-scss/ (put all your scss files here)
		-index.js (This file imports the components and renders them -- Entry point for webpack bundling)
	-public/
		-bundle.js (bundled js file containing all the components and necessary code-- automatically generated by webpack)
		-index.html
		-manifest.json
		-favicon.ico
	-webpack.config.js (bundles up all the js files and stores it in the public folder)
	-server.js (entry point for the application to connect to)
```
